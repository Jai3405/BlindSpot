# BlindSpot AI - Performance Improvements

## Issues Identified
1. **Detection threshold too high** (35%) - missing obstacles
2. **Warning distances too conservative** - alerts coming too late
3. **Audio feedback too infrequent** - missing critical moments
4. **Model trained on limited objects** - 46.7% mAP on COCO dataset

## Changes Made

### 1. Lower Detection Threshold
- **Before:** `conf_threshold=0.35` (35%)
- **After:** `conf_threshold=0.15` (15%)
- **Impact:** Detects more objects, including lower-confidence obstacles

### 2. Increased Warning Distances
- **Critical:** 1.5m → 2.5m (earlier warnings)
- **Warning:** 3.0m → 4.0m  
- **Info:** 5.0m → 6.0m
- **Impact:** More time to react to obstacles

### 3. More Frequent Audio Alerts
- **Before:** Every 30 frames (~1 second)
- **After:** Every 15 frames (~0.5 seconds)
- **Impact:** Faster reaction time

## How to Test

```bash
./venv/bin/python demo_blindspot.py --mode webcam --camera 0
```

## Expected Improvements
- ✅ Earlier obstacle detection
- ✅ More frequent audio warnings
- ✅ Better detection of low-confidence objects
- ✅ Wider detection range (up to 6m)

## Known Limitations
- Model still limited to COCO objects (80 classes)
- Distance estimation is approximate
- Performance depends on lighting/camera quality
- May have more false positives with lower threshold

## Next Steps for Better Performance
1. Train on more diverse obstacles (furniture, walls, doors)
2. Calibrate distance estimation with real measurements
3. Add haptic feedback for critical alerts
4. Implement object tracking to reduce false positives
