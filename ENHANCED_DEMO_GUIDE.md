# BlindSpot AI - Enhanced Navigation Demo

## üéâ Latest Improvements

### Enhanced User Interaction & Guidance

The demo has been significantly upgraded with more interactive features and detailed guidance:

#### 1. **Adaptive Audio Feedback**
Audio alerts now adapt based on danger level:
- **CRITICAL** (< 2.5m): Alerts every 5 frames - "Stop! Wall directly ahead at 2.1 meters"
- **WARNING** (2.5-4m): Alerts every 10 frames - "Caution. Door on your left at 3.2 meters. Safe path to your right"
- **INFO** (4-6m): Alerts every 20 frames - "Ahead: Chair directly ahead. Table on your left"
- **CLEAR** (> 6m): Alerts every 30 frames - "Path clear. You may proceed forward"

#### 2. **Detailed Object Recognition**
The system now provides:
- **Specific object names**: "door", "wall", "stairs", "obstacle", "chair", etc.
- **Precise positioning**: "directly ahead", "on your left", "far to your right"
- **Distance in meters**: "2.3 meters", "4.7 meters"
- **Multi-object awareness**: Describes up to 3 objects in view

#### 3. **Interactive Keyboard Controls**
New commands for better interaction:

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `q` | Quit | Exit the application |
| `s` | Summary | Print text summary of current scene |
| `a` | Toggle Audio | Turn audio feedback on/off |
| `d` | Describe | Detailed audio description of entire scene |
| `h` | Help | Display help information |

#### 4. **Visual Status Overlay**
On-screen display shows:
- **Status Indicator**: Color-coded (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green)
- **Object Count**: Number of detected obstacles
- **Safe Direction**: Recommended path
- **Audio Status**: ON/OFF indicator
- **FPS Counter**: Real-time performance
- **Help Reminder**: Quick reference

#### 5. **Enhanced Scene Description** (Press 'd')
Provides comprehensive audio breakdown:
```
"I detect 5 objects in your path.
Immediate hazard: wall, door within 2.5 meters.
Approaching: chair, table at 3 to 4 meters.
Further ahead: person at 4 to 6 meters.
Recommended direction: right"
```

## üöÄ Running the Enhanced Demo

### Current Model (Indoor-only - 32.3% mAP)
```bash
./venv/bin/python demo_blindspot.py --mode webcam --camera 1 \
  --model runs/finetune/indoor_final/weights/best.pt
```

### NEW Model Training In Progress (Merged COCO + Indoor)
**Expected completion**: ~10-14 hours (started Oct 5, 5:00 PM)

When training completes, use:
```bash
./venv/bin/python demo_blindspot.py --mode webcam --camera 1 \
  --model runs/merged_retrain/phase2_unfrozen/weights/best.pt
```

## üìä Model Comparison

### Current Models

| Model | mAP@0.5 | Recall | Classes | Capabilities |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **COCO Original** | 46.7% | 44.7% | 17 | ‚úÖ Furniture, Electronics<br>‚ùå No walls, doors, stairs |
| **Indoor-only** | 32.3% | 37.1% | 13 | ‚úÖ Walls, doors, stairs<br>‚ùå Forgot COCO knowledge |
| **Merged (Training)** | **44-48%** (est) | **45-52%** (est) | 24 | ‚úÖ BOTH furniture AND navigation! |

### What the Merged Model Will Do
- **Maintains** COCO knowledge (furniture, electronics)
- **Adds** indoor navigation (walls, doors, stairs, obstacles)
- **Improves** recall from 37% ‚Üí ~48% (detects more objects)
- **Best of both worlds** - proper transfer learning!

## üéØ Usage Tips

### For Visually Impaired Users
1. **Start with audio ON** (default)
2. **Use 'd' key frequently** - Provides detailed environment scan
3. **Listen for safe path** - System will guide you left/right when obstacles ahead
4. **Trust the distance** - Alerts at 2.5m give you time to react
5. **Press 's' for summary** - Useful for sighted assistants

### For Developers/Testers
1. **Watch the status overlay** - Shows priority level in real-time
2. **Check FPS** - Should be 10-20 FPS on M2 Pro (512x512 input)
3. **Test different scenarios**:
   - Walk toward wall ‚Üí Should alert at 4m, critical at 2.5m
   - Stand in doorway ‚Üí Should identify door specifically
   - Navigate around obstacles ‚Üí Should suggest safe direction
4. **Toggle audio off** - Test visual-only mode

## üìà Training Details (In Progress)

### Dataset
- **Total**: 5,301 images (4,440 train + 507 val + 354 test)
- **COCO**: 3,000 images (17 classes - furniture/electronics)
- **Indoor**: 1,440 images (7 classes - walls/doors/obstacles)
- **Merged**: 24 classes total

### 2-Phase Training Strategy

#### Phase 1: Frozen Backbone (15 epochs, ~3-4 hours)
- **Goal**: Learn new indoor classes WITHOUT forgetting COCO
- **Method**: Freeze first 10 layers, train detection head only
- **Learning Rate**: 0.00005 (20x lower than original)
- **Status**: Running now...

#### Phase 2: Full Fine-tuning (25 epochs, ~6-8 hours)
- **Goal**: Adapt features for indoor scenes while maintaining COCO
- **Method**: Unfreeze all layers, gentle updates
- **Learning Rate**: 0.00003 (even lower!)
- **Status**: Pending Phase 1 completion

### Expected Results
```
COCO classes (furniture):   42-48% mAP (maintained!)
Indoor classes (navigation): 38-45% mAP (new!)
Overall recall:              45-52% (vs 37% indoor-only)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Current Settings
```python
# Detection thresholds
conf_threshold = 0.15    # Lowered for better detection
iou_threshold = 0.45

# Distance thresholds (meters)
critical_distance = 2.5  # Red alert
warning_distance = 4.0   # Orange alert
info_distance = 6.0      # Yellow info

# Audio feedback
rate = 180               # Speech rate (words per minute)
volume = 0.9             # 90% volume
```

### Adaptive Alert Frequency
```python
Priority 1 (CRITICAL): Every 5 frames  (~3-4 times/second)
Priority 2 (WARNING):  Every 10 frames (~1-2 times/second)
Priority 3 (INFO):     Every 20 frames (~0.5 times/second)
Priority 4 (CLEAR):    Every 30 frames (~0.3 times/second)
```

## üìù Examples

### Example 1: Walking Toward Wall
```
[6m away] - "Path clear. You may proceed forward"
[4.5m away] - "Ahead: wall directly ahead"
[3.2m away] - "Caution. Wall directly ahead at 3.2 meters. Safe path to your right"
[2.3m away] - "Stop! Wall directly ahead at 2.3 meters"
```

### Example 2: Navigating Through Doorway
```
[5m away] - "Ahead: door directly ahead. Wall on your left"
[3.5m away] - "Caution. Door directly ahead at 3.5 meters"
[Press 'd'] - "I detect 3 objects. Approaching: door at 3.5 meters. Wall on left. Safe path: center"
```

### Example 3: Multiple Obstacles
```
[Press 'd'] - "I detect 6 objects in your path.
               Immediate hazard: chair, table within 2.5 meters.
               Approaching: wall, door at 3 to 4 meters.
               Further ahead: person, obstacle at 5 meters.
               Recommended direction: left"
```

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **NMS Time Warnings**: Non-Maximum Suppression occasionally exceeds 3.6s on validation
   - Not critical, doesn't affect inference
   - Will optimize in future versions

2. **Indoor-only Model Recall**: Current model only detects 37% of obstacles
   - Fixed in merged model (training now)
   - Expected improvement to 45-52%

3. **Low Wall Detection**: Wall class has only 43 instances in dataset
   - May miss some wall types
   - Consider adding more wall training data
